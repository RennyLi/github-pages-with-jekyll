Today I'm a little sad. Maybe it is because I stayed up very late yesterday. 
But that's because I went to the love presented my drum teacher's band.
I think it is deservable, although maybe nobody cares about my feelings.
It doesn't matter. I will grow up and become more and more strong.
On that day, I won't be hurt anymore.
